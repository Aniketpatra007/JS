-> js is a synchronous and single threaded language (default js behaviour)
  as js is single threaded it can be slow, but the slowness cannot be felt because the js engine never come alone, it has always a runtime environment, this runtime environment can be browser's runtime environment, nodejs's runtime environment etc
  
-> Execution Context: execute one line of code at a time
    each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

Blocking Code -> Block the flow of the Program -> read file sync
Non Blocking code -> Does not block execution -> Read File Async
